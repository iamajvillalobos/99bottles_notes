### Chapter 1

> If you're willing to accept increases in the complexity of your code along
some dimensions, you'll be rewarded with decreases in complexity along others.
OOD doesn't claim to be free; it merely asserts that its benefits outweigh its
costs.

> The code you write should meet two often contradictory goals. It must remain 
concrete enough to be understood while simultaneously being abstract enough 
to allow for change.
